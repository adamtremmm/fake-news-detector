4/22 AI final project progress update
=====================================

Project concept: Fake news detector robust to adversarial attacks (ie, fake news classifiers + fact-checking)

- Completed:

	1. downloaded and processed data for fake news classifiers
	2. trained 3 different classification models with good performance
	3. front-end ui design


- TODO:

	1. fact-checking system
		- system design
		- selected this library:
	2. classifier improvements
		- further data engineering for more model-building flexibility
	3. additional front-end ui features? -> ui completion
